Basic Image Processing
===========================

There are three reasons for creating this open-source application.

The main purpose of this app is to showcase a very basic implementation of several simple image processing techniques without using any sophisticated libraries. Secondly, the app demonstrates how to use Gradle and CMake to build and link a custom native library and how to call some of the Android NDK APIs. Finally, the app shows how to call into methods of a C library via a Java Native Interface.
