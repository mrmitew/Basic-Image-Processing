Basic Image Processing
===========================

This open-source application aims at demonstrating:
* a very basic implementation of several simple image processing techniques without using any sophisticated libraries
* how to use Gradle and CMake to build and link a custom native library
* how to call some of the Android NDK APIs
* how to call into methods of a native library via a Java Native Interface

You can either build it yourself or download it from the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stetcho.basicimageprocessing

## Dependencies
There are quite a few, but non of them were absolutely necessary for the purpose of this app since they were used mostly for convenience.
* Retrolambda
* RxJava
* RxAndroid
* Butterknife
* AppCompat
